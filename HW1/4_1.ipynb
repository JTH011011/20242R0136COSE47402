    "Discussion: In this chapter, I learned about softmax regression, a method for estimating the probability that a given input belongs to a specific class. I had previously read a popular science book on deep learning, where I vaguely understood that the softmax function outputs values between 0 and 1, sums them to 1, and that these values represent probabilities. However, I didn't fully understand the detailed process of how the loss function is calculated using one-hot encoding. This was something new I learned. I also found it interesting that Cross-Entropy Error (CEE) is used as the loss function."
